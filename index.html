            <h3 class="question">Muscovy</h3>
            <p id="muscovy-tooltip-text" class="question">In the 15th century, Muscovy (also known as the Grand Duchy of
                Moscow)
                experienced significant political, territorial, and cultural developments. Here are some key events and
                highlights of what happened in Muscovy during that time:<br><br>

                Rise of Ivan III: Ivan III, also known as Ivan the Great, ruled Muscovy from 1462 to 1505. His reign
                marked a turning point in Muscovite history, as he expanded the territory, consolidated power, and
                challenged the authority of the Mongol-Tatar Golden Horde. <br><br>

                Consolidation of Territory: Ivan III significantly expanded Muscovy's territory by annexing neighboring
                regions and principalities. Notable acquisitions include Novgorod, Tver, Yaroslavl, and Rostov. These
                territorial gains contributed to the formation of a centralized Muscovite state.<br><br>

                Assertion of Independence: Muscovy gradually asserted its independence from the Mongol-Tatar Golden
                Horde. Ivan III refused to pay tribute to the Horde and instead adopted the title of "Sovereign of all
                Rus." This move symbolized the growing autonomy and self-identification of Muscovy as the successor of
                the ancient Kievan Rus.<br><br>

                Moscow as the Capital: Moscow emerged as the political and cultural center of Muscovy during the 15th
                century. Ivan III undertook significant construction projects in Moscow, including the expansion of the
                Moscow Kremlin, the construction of the Cathedral of the Annunciation, and the rebuilding of the
                Dormition Cathedral.<br><br>

                Cultural and Religious Developments: Muscovy experienced a cultural and religious awakening during the
                15th century. Ivan III promoted Byzantine and Orthodox influences in art, architecture, and religious
                practices. He also invited Italian architects, artists, and scholars to Muscovy, contributing to the
                Renaissance influences in the region.<br><br>

                The Third Rome Doctrine: In the late 15th century, Muscovy developed the idea of the "Third Rome." This
                doctrine asserted that Moscow, as the spiritual and political successor to Rome and Constantinople, was
                the rightful center of Christian civilization.<br><br>

                Legal Reforms: Ivan III enacted significant legal reforms during his reign, which aimed to consolidate
                and centralize power. He established a unified legal code known as the "Sudebnik," which standardized
                legal procedures and expanded the authority of the central government.<br><br>

                These developments in Muscovy during the 15th century laid the foundation for the future growth and
                expansion of the Russian state. The consolidation of territory, the assertion of independence, and the
                cultural and religious transformations played a crucial role in shaping Muscovite and later Russian
                history.</p>

            <h3 class="question">Denmark</h3>
            <p id="denmark-tooltip-text" class="question">In the 15th century, Denmark, under the rule of the Kalmar
                Union, experienced
                several significant events and developments. Here are some key highlights of what happened in Denmark
                during that time:<br><br>

                Kalmar Union: The Kalmar Union was formed in 1397 and included Denmark, Sweden, and Norway under the
                rule of a single monarch. In the 15th century, Denmark played a dominant role within the union, with
                Danish monarchs often holding the position of the Union King.<br><br>

                Eric of Pomerania: Eric of Pomerania, who reigned from 1396 to 1439, was a notable Danish king during
                the 15th century. He worked to consolidate the power of the Kalmar Union and initiated administrative
                and legal reforms within Denmark.<br><br>

                Expansion of Danish Territory: Denmark sought to expand its territory during the 15th century. It
                successfully acquired the territories of Schleswig, Holstein, and Lauenburg, establishing a dominant
                presence in northern Germany.<br><br>

                Struggles within the Kalmar Union: The Kalmar Union faced internal struggles during the 15th century, as
                each kingdom within the union sought to maintain its independence and assert its interests. Denmark
                clashed with Sweden and Norway over issues such as taxation, trade, and the extent of royal power.
                <br><br>
                The Sound Dues: In the 15th century, Denmark established the Sound Dues, a toll collected from ships
                passing through the Øresund strait. This created a significant source of revenue for the Danish crown
                and helped maintain Denmark's dominance over trade in the Baltic Sea.<br><br>

                Christian I and the Union of Kalmar: Christian I, who ruled from 1448 to 1481, sought to strengthen the
                Kalmar Union. He attempted to assert his authority over Sweden, which led to a rebellion in 1471 and
                increased tensions within the union.<br><br>

                Religious Developments: The 15th century saw religious changes in Denmark. The Roman Catholic Church
                remained the dominant institution, but there were also movements that questioned church practices and
                advocated for reform.<br><br>

                The Sound Toll Register: In 1429, Denmark established the Sound Toll Register, a comprehensive record of
                ships passing through the Øresund. This register provided valuable information on trade and shipping
                activities in the region and became an essential economic resource for Denmark.<br><br>

                These events and developments in Denmark during the 15th century influenced the country's political
                dynamics, territorial expansion, and trade relationships within the Kalmar Union and the wider Baltic
                region.</p>

                social changes,
                marked by significant events and developments. Here are some key highlights of what happened in England
                during that time:<br><br>

                Wars of the Roses: The 15th century saw the Wars of the Roses, a series of civil wars fought between two
                rival branches of the Plantagenet dynasty, the House of Lancaster and the House of York. These
                conflicts, which began in the 1450s, resulted in a power struggle for the English throne. The wars ended
                in 1485 with the victory of Henry Tudor, who became King Henry VII, establishing the Tudor
                dynasty.<br><br>

                Hundred Years' War: The 15th century witnessed the final stages of the Hundred Years' War between
                England and France. The war, which had begun in the 14th century, saw England gradually losing its
                territories in France. The conflict officially ended in 1453 with the French victory at the Battle of
                Castillon.<br><br>

                Henry V: King Henry V, who reigned from 1413 to 1422, was a prominent figure in English history during
                the 15th century. He achieved military successes, including the famous Battle of Agincourt in 1415, and
                temporarily restored English control over parts of France.<br><br>

                Rise of the Tudor Dynasty: The Tudor dynasty came to power in the late 15th century. Henry Tudor, who
                became Henry VII, won the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, effectively ending the Wars of the Roses.
                The Tudor dynasty, which lasted until 1603, brought stability and significant changes to
                England.<br><br>

                Cultural and Intellectual Developments: The 15th century in England witnessed the flourishing of the
                English Renaissance. Influenced by the Italian Renaissance, there was an increased focus on literature,
                art, and intellectual pursuits. Notable writers and poets of this period include Geoffrey Chaucer,
                Thomas Malory, and John Lydgate.<br><br>

                Printing Press: The introduction of the printing press to England in the late 15th century
                revolutionized the dissemination of knowledge and played a significant role in the spread of ideas and
                the standardization of the English language.<br><br>

                Henry VI: The reign of Henry VI, who ruled from 1422 to 1461 and again from 1470 to 1471, was
                characterized by political instability and conflicts, including the Wars of the Roses. His reign saw

                These events and developments in England during the 15th century shaped the course of English history
                and set the stage for the dramatic changes and transformations that would occur in the following
                centuries.</p>

            <p id="france-tooltip-text" class="question">The 15th century was a transformative period for France, marked
                by significant
                political, cultural, and military events. Here are some key highlights of what happened in France during
                that time:<br><br>

                Hundred Years' War: The 15th century witnessed the final stages of the Hundred Years' War, a
                long-standing conflict between the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of France. French forces, led by
                notable figures like Joan of Arc, achieved significant victories, such as the lifting of the Siege of
                Orléans in 1429. This conflict ended with the French reclaiming most of their territories, and the
                Treaty of Picquigny in 1475 brought a temporary peace between the two nations.<br><br>

                Charles VII and Louis XI: Charles VII succeeded to the French throne in 1422 and played a vital role in
                the recovery of French territories during the Hundred Years' War. His reign also witnessed the trial and
                eventual canonization of Joan of Arc. Following Charles VII, his son Louis XI became king in 1461 and is
                known for centralizing power and expanding the royal domain.<br><br>

                Renaissance in France: The 15th century marked the beginning of the French Renaissance, characterized by
                a revival of art, literature, and learning inspired by Italian models. The reign of Charles VII and his
                successors saw the patronage of artists, including the poet François Villon and the painter Jean
                Fouquet.<br><br>

                Burgundian Wars: The Burgundian Wars, a series of conflicts between the Valois monarchy and the Duchy of
                Burgundy, took place throughout the 15th century. These wars were mainly driven by territorial disputes
                and power struggles, involving influential figures such as Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, and Louis
                XI of France.<br><br>

                Treaty of Arras (1435): The Treaty of Arras marked a turning point in the Burgundian Wars. It
                established a temporary alliance between Philip the Good and Charles VII against England, leading to a
                truce in the larger conflict.<br><br>

                The Estates-General: The Estates-General, an assembly representing the three estates (clergy, nobility,
                and commoners), played a significant role in French politics during the 15th century. Its convocation in
                1484 under Louis XI aimed to address financial and political issues within the kingdom.<br><br>

                Book of Hours and Illuminated Manuscripts: The 15th century saw the production of many exquisite
                illuminated manuscripts in France, including the famous Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry, a lavishly
                illustrated book of hours commissioned by John, Duke of Berry.<br><br>

                These events and developments shaped the political landscape, cultural achievements, and the trajectory
                of France during the 15th century, laying the foundation for future transformations in the country's
                history.</p>

            <p id="castile-tooltip-text" class="question">The 15th century was a crucial period for the Kingdom of
                Castile, which was
                part of the medieval Christian realms on the Iberian Peninsula. Here are some significant events and
                developments that took place in Castile during that time:<br><br>

                Reign of Henry IV: At the beginning of the century, Henry IV ascended to the throne of Castile in 1454.
                His reign was marked by political instability and conflicts within the nobility, including disputes over
                the succession to the throne.<br><br>

                War of the Castilian Succession: The War of the Castilian Succession erupted in the mid-15th century as
                a result of the contested legitimacy of Henry IV's daughter, Joanna la Beltraneja, as the heir to the
                throne. This conflict pitted Joanna's supporters against those of Henry's half-sister, Isabella of
                Castile, and her husband, Ferdinand of Aragon.<br><br>

                Marriage of Isabella and Ferdinand: In 1469, Isabella of Castile married Ferdinand of Aragon, uniting
                two of the most powerful kingdoms on the Iberian Peninsula. This marriage eventually led to the creation
                of a united Spain and had far-reaching consequences for Castile and its future.<br><br>

                Completion of the Reconquista: The 15th century witnessed the final stages of the Reconquista, the
                centuries-long Christian reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula from Muslim rule. Castile played a
                significant role in this process and successfully completed the Reconquista with the capture of the
                Emirate of Granada in 1492.<br><br>

                Christopher Columbus: Castile sponsored the famous voyages of Christopher Columbus, which led to the
                exploration and colonization of the Americas. In 1492, Columbus, under the patronage of Isabella and
                Ferdinand, set sail from Spain and reached the Caribbean, initiating a new era of European overseas
                expansion.<br><br>

                Spanish Inquisition: In 1478, the Catholic Monarchs (Isabella and Ferdinand) established the Spanish
                Inquisition, a tribunal tasked with maintaining religious orthodoxy and eliminating heresy. The
                Inquisition had a significant impact on religious and social life in Castile, leading to the persecution
                and expulsion of religious minorities.<br><br>

                Expulsion of Jews and Muslims: In 1492, as part of their efforts to establish religious homogeneity,
                Isabella and Ferdinand issued the Edict of Expulsion, which ordered the expulsion of Jews from Castile.
                This event had a profound effect on the cultural and economic life of the kingdom.<br><br>

                These events and developments in Castile during the 15th century laid the foundation for the
                consolidation of power, exploration, and colonization, ultimately leading to the rise of Spain as a
                dominant European power in the following centuries.</p>

            <p id="brandenburg-tooltip-text" class="question">In the 15th century, the Duchy of Brandenburg, located in
                what is now
                northeastern Germany, experienced significant political and territorial developments. Here are some key
                events and developments that took place in the Duchy of Brandenburg during that time:<br><br>

                Hohenzollern Dynasty: The 15th century marked the rise of the Hohenzollern dynasty in Brandenburg. The
                dynasty, originally from Franconia, gradually expanded its influence and control over the region. The
                Hohenzollerns played a crucial role in shaping the future Kingdom of Prussia.<br><br>

                Treaty of Cölln (1442): The Treaty of Cölln was signed between the Electorate of Brandenburg, ruled by
                Frederick II of Hohenzollern, and the Margraviate of Brandenburg-Kulmbach. The treaty solidified the
                Hohenzollerns' control over the region and established them as the sole rulers of Brandenburg.<br><br>

                Expansion and Consolidation: Under the Hohenzollern rulers, Brandenburg expanded its territories during
                the 15th century. The acquisition of lands such as Pomerania, Neumark, and Altmark significantly
                increased the duchy's size and power.<br><br>

                Brandenburg as an Electorate: In 1415, Brandenburg was elevated to an electorate by Emperor Sigismund,
                granting it additional political and administrative privileges within the Holy Roman Empire.<br><br>

                Berlin as the Capital: In the late 15th century, the Hohenzollern rulers made Berlin their primary
                residence and began developing it as the capital city of Brandenburg. The expansion and construction of
                notable landmarks, such as the Berlin City Palace, laid the foundation for Berlin's future growth and
                significance.<br><br>

                The Reformation: The Reformation, led by Martin Luther, had a profound impact on Brandenburg in the 16th
                century. However, its early seeds were sown in the late 15th century. Some Brandenburg rulers, like
                Joachim I and Joachim II, expressed sympathy towards the Reformation, leading to religious tensions
                within the region.<br><br>

                Territorial Disputes: Brandenburg faced territorial disputes and conflicts with neighboring states
                during the 15th century. These disputes included conflicts with the Teutonic Order over territories in
                Prussia and conflicts with the Kingdom of Poland over control of lands in Pomerania.<br><br>

                The developments in the Duchy of Brandenburg during the 15th century laid the foundation for the future
                growth and prominence of the region under the Hohenzollern dynasty. It set the stage for the eventual
                establishment of the Kingdom of Prussia and its subsequent role in shaping German history.</p>

            <p id="austria-tooltip-text" class="question">In the 15th century, Austria was part of the Holy Roman
                Empire, which was a complex political entity in Central Europe. Here are some significant events and
                developments that occurred in Austria during that time:<br><br>

                Habsburg Dynasty: The House of Habsburg, one of Europe's most influential ruling families, played a
                crucial role in Austria's history during the 15th century. The Habsburgs gradually expanded their
                territorial holdings and established their power base in Austria.<br><br>

                Battle of Nikolsburg (1424): This battle was fought between the forces of the Austrian Duke Albert V and
                the Hussites, followers of the religious reformer Jan Hus. The Hussites emerged victorious, which
                temporarily weakened Habsburg influence in the region.<br><br>

                Frederick III: Frederick III, a member of the Habsburg family, became the Holy Roman Emperor in 1452. He
                focused on consolidating Habsburg power and promoting the interests of his dynasty.<br><br>

                Siege of Vienna (1485): Matthias Corvinus, the King of Hungary, laid siege to Vienna in an attempt to
                expand his influence. However, the city successfully defended itself, preserving Habsburg control over
                Austria.<br><br>

                Maximilian I: Maximilian I, a prominent Habsburg ruler, ascended to the throne in 1493. He pursued an
                ambitious territorial policy and sought to strengthen the position of the Habsburgs within the Holy
                Roman Empire.<br><br>

                The Court of the Habsburgs: Vienna became a center of Renaissance culture during the 15th century. The
                Habsburg court attracted artists, scholars, and intellectuals, contributing to the city's intellectual
                and artistic development.<br><br>

                Exploration and Colonization: In the late 15th century, Austrian explorers and navigators, such as Georg
                von Peuerbach and Andreas Baumkircher, made significant contributions to the field of astronomy and
                cartography, expanding knowledge of the world.<br><br>

                It's worth noting that Austria was also affected by broader European developments, such as the
                Protestant Reformation that emerged in the 16th century, leading to religious tensions and conflicts
                across the continent. However, these events occurred after the 15th century.</p><br>

                and social
                changes. Here are some key events and developments that occurred in Poland during that time:<br><br>

                Union of Krewo (1385): While the Union of Krewo technically took place in the late 14th century, its
                consequences had a lasting impact on 15th-century Poland. The union established a personal union between
                Poland and Lithuania, forming the basis of the future Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.<br><br>

                Jagiellonian Dynasty: The 15th century saw the reign of the Jagiellonian dynasty in Poland. This dynasty
                played a crucial role in shaping the country's history during this period. Notable rulers of the dynasty
                include Władysław II Jagiełło (reigned 1386-1434), Władysław III (reigned 1434-1444), and Casimir IV
                (reigned 1447-1492).<br><br>

                Battle of Grunwald (1410): This significant military engagement took place between the Polish-Lithuanian
                forces and the Teutonic Knights, a powerful military order. The Polish-Lithuanian forces achieved a
                decisive victory, effectively weakening the Teutonic Knights and establishing the Polish-Lithuanian
                alliance as a major power in the region.<br><br>

                Union of Horodło (1413): The Union of Horodło formalized the legal and religious rights of various
                ethnic and religious communities within the Polish-Lithuanian state. It granted privileges and
                protections to different groups, including Jews, Ruthenians, and Tatars, fostering a diverse and
                multicultural society.<br><br>

                Council of Constance (1414-1418): Poland was involved in the Council of Constance, a significant church
                council that aimed to resolve the Western Schism and address other ecclesiastical issues. The council
                contributed to the overall religious and political developments of the time.<br><br>

                Expansion of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth: Throughout the 15th century, the Polish-Lithuanian
                Commonwealth expanded its territories through military campaigns and political alliances. The
                Commonwealth annexed regions such as Pomerania, Greater Poland, and Mazovia, consolidating its power in
                central and eastern Europe.<br><br>

                Cultural and Intellectual Developments: The 15th century witnessed a blossoming of culture and learning
                in Poland. The University of Kraków (later renamed Jagiellonian University) was founded in 1364 and
                became an important center of education and intellectual activity.<br><br>

                Hussite Wars: Poland was indirectly affected by the Hussite Wars, a religious conflict in Bohemia. The
                Jagiellonian dynasty had matrimonial ties with the Hussite movement, and there were occasional
                skirmishes between Polish and Hussite forces near the border regions.<br><br>

                These events shaped the political landscape, cultural achievements, and the consolidation of power
                within the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in the 15th century, laying the groundwork for future
                developments in the region.</p>

            <p id="ottoman-tooltip-text" class="question">The 15th century was a crucial period for the Ottoman Empire,
                marked by
                significant expansions and important developments. Here are some key events that occurred in the Ottoman
                Empire during that time:<br><br>

                Conquest of Constantinople (1453): One of the most momentous events of the 15th century was the Ottoman
                conquest of Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire. Led by Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror, the
                Ottomans captured the city on May 29, 1453, bringing an end to the Byzantine Empire and establishing
                Istanbul (formerly Constantinople) as the new capital of the Ottoman Empire.<br><br>

                Expansion into the Balkans: In the 15th century, the Ottomans continued their expansion into the
                Balkans, conquering territories previously held by various Balkan states. Significant conquests included
                Serbia (1459), Bosnia (1463), Albania (1478), and parts of Hungary (1526). These expansions established
                the Ottoman Empire as a major power in southeastern Europe.<br><br>

                Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror: Mehmed II, also known as Mehmed the Conqueror, ruled the Ottoman Empire
                during the mid-15th century. Besides capturing Constantinople, he implemented administrative reforms,
                promoted cultural and intellectual development, and transformed Istanbul into a thriving
                capital.<br><br>

                Naval Dominance: The Ottoman Empire achieved naval supremacy in the eastern Mediterranean during the
                15th century. The Ottoman fleet, led by admirals like Baltaoglu and Kemal Reis, conducted successful
                campaigns against various Christian maritime powers and secured control over strategic
                waterways.<br><br>

                Administrative Reforms: Mehmed II initiated significant administrative reforms known as the "Kanunname,"
                aimed at centralizing power and consolidating the empire. These reforms standardized taxation,
                established a professional military, and created a hierarchical administrative structure.<br><br>

                Cultural and Architectural Achievements: The 15th century witnessed a flourishing of Ottoman
                architecture and artistic patronage. Notable architectural projects include the construction of the
                Topkapi Palace, the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul, and the Şehzade Mosque in Edirne.<br><br>

                Rise of the Janissaries: The Janissaries, an elite infantry corps composed of Christian slave soldiers,
                played a vital role in the expansion and governance of the Ottoman Empire during the 15th century. They
                became a powerful political and military force, but their influence would later pose challenges to the
                empire's stability.<br><br>

                The 15th century marked a period of territorial expansion, institutional reforms, and cultural
                achievements for the Ottoman Empire, setting the stage for its continued growth and dominance in the
                centuries to come.</p>
