# Europe1444
# is an implementation of a quiz based on an image map using jQuery, mapHilight and rwdImageMaps. it aims to show how fun it can be to connect coding and history.
# while its not finished and styled yet, its now on a stable version.
# upcoming features will aim to improve the responsivness especially for small devices, implement an "endresult"-feature and add another timelines. 
# ressources for a 1792-timeline are already added but not yet functional. smth prevents the switch from one map to another to be updatet correctly and IÂ´m still trying to
# find the reason for that
